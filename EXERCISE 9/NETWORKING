## Task 
193.16.20.35/29

Calculate  the Network IP,number of hosts,range of IP addresses and Broadcast IP from this subnet

This is an IPV4 adress because there are 32 bits made up of four octets of 8 bits each. 


The first step to take in a task such as this is to obtain the subnet mask from the given IP address above.

This is done by finding host range and converting to binary first. 

From the IP above the subnet mask in binary form would be;
11111111.11111111.11111111.11111000

The subnet mask that has been obtained would be converted to decimal form.

### Calculate the total number of hosts per subnet.

The sum of all the subnet mask in decimal = 255.255.255.248

## NETWORK IP
The network IP is the portion of an IP adress that identifies the TCP/IP network on which a host resides.

the network ID is calculated by

the first three Octet of our IP as earlier calculated above is constant. We would simply calculate the last octet to derive our network ID

Fourth octet - 11111000
Given IP 0010001

The result of this is = 00100000

32

The network ID is 193.16.20.32

## Number of Hosts 

The number of hosts is  calculated with a simple formula;
2*-2, where x is the number of hosts host ID bits in the IP adress

We have 3 hosts bits from this we have a total of 6 hosts.

## Broadcast IP address

These are expressed as a set of four numbers 
This is based on your IP address and subnet mask.


### Network ip = 193.16.20.32
### Number of hosts = 6
### Range of IP Adress 
### Broadcast IP = 193.16.20.39
